# Problem Solving with Algorithmic Patterns

This repository is my personal prep for technical interviews, focused on solving problems **by identifying and applying algorithmic patterns** â€” not just brute-forcing tasks one by one.

## ðŸ“Œ Why Patterns?

ðŸ”¹ Most LeetCode problems are variations of ~15â€“20 core patterns  
ðŸ”¹ Recognizing patterns makes solving problems faster and more predictable  
ðŸ”¹ Itâ€™s a systematic and scalable approach that actually works in interviews

## âœ… Structure

Each section in this repo represents one core pattern.

Inside each folder:
- Pattern explanation + basic example
- 3â€“5 LeetCode problems
- My solutions with comments
- Links to the original problems
